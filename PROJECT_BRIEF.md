# PlantCare Project Brief

PlantCare is a modular platform for helping plant enthusiasts identify species, plan ongoing care, and monitor plant health trends. The codebase is organized around clear separation of responsibilities: `app/` for client-facing interfaces, `core/` for domain logic and shared types, `services/` for external integrations, and `config/` for application-level configuration. Future iterations will expand on these foundations to deliver mobile and web experiences supported by intelligent automation.
